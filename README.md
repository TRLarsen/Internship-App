# Internship-App
A time clock for Nebo Interns.

This Web App was created with the goal of streamlining and digitizing the Intern time clocking process for Interns in Nebo School District (located in Northern Utah).

In order to accomplish this goal the web app gathers data from the user's native device (though this may have to be changed to remote time assignment to combat incorrect device times/privacy tools such as VPN's)
and their inputs into a form, then submits that data to a Google Sheet through the apispreadsheets tool maintained by We Love Spreadsheets.

# Internship-App
A time clock for Nebo Interns.

This Web App was created with the goal of streamlining and digitizing the Intern time clocking process for Interns in Nebo School District (located in Northern Utah).

In order to accomplish this goal the web app gathers inputs into a form, then submits that data to an district server.
